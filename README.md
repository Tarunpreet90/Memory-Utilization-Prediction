This Python code utilizes TensorFlow and Keras to implement an LSTM model for forecasting memory utilization based on time series data. After preprocessing and visualizing the dataset, it applies MinMax scaling and sequences the data into input-output pairs for training the LSTM model. The model architecture consists of two LSTM layers and Dense layers. Early stopping is employed during training to prevent overfitting. Loss progression is visualized, and the model is used to predict memory utilization on training and validation sets. Predicted values are inverse transformed for comparison with actual values. This code serves as a comprehensive example of building and training an LSTM model for time series forecasting, specifically tailored to memory utilization prediction
